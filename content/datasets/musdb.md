# MUSDB18

<img src="./assets/musheader.png" alt="Drawing"/>

The _musdb18_ is a dataset of 150 full lengths music tracks (~10h duration) of different genres along with their isolated _drums_, _bass_, _vocals_ and _others_ stems.

_musdb18_ contains two folders, a folder with a training set: "train", composed of 100 songs, and a folder with a test set: "test", composed of 50 songs. Supervised approaches should be trained on the training set and tested on both sets.

All signals are stereophonic and encoded at 44.1kHz.

The data from _musdb18_ is composed of several different sources:
* 100 tracks are taken from the [DSD100 dataset](dsd100.md), which is itself derived from [The 'Mixing Secrets' Free Multitrack Download Library](https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/). Please refer to this original resource for any question regarding your rights on your use of the DSD100 data.
* 46 tracks are taken from [the MedleyDB](http://medleydb.weebly.com) licensed under Creative Commons (BY-NC-SA 4.0).
* 2 tracks were kindly provided by Native Instruments originally part of [their stems pack](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/specials/stems-for-all/free-stems-tracks/).
* 2 tracks are from the Canadian rock band The Easton Ellises as part of the [heise stems remix competition](https://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/c-t-Remix-Wettbewerb-The-Easton-Ellises-2542427.html#englisch), licensed under Creative Commons (BY-NC-SA 3.0).

A detailed list of all tracks and their respective license is provided [here](https://github.com/sigsep/website/blob/master/content/datasets/assets/tracklist.csv).

::: tip Note
 The dataset is hosted on Zenodo and requires that users request access, since the tracks can only be used for academic purposes. We __manually__ check this requests. Please _do not_ fill the form multiple times, it usually takes as less than a day to give you access.

## `MUSDB18` Compressed STEMS

<img src="./assets/stems.png" align="right" width="190px">

All files from the _musdb18_ dataset are encoded in the [Native Instruments stems format](http://www.stems-music.com/) (.mp4). It is a multitrack format composed of 5 stereo streams, each one encoded in AAC @256kbps. These signals correspond to:

- `0` - The mixture,
- `1` - The drums,
- `2` - The bass,
- `3` - The rest of the accompaniment,
- `4` - The vocals.

For each file, the mixture correspond to the sum of all the signals.

::: tip Note
Since the mixture is separately encoded as AAC, there there is a small difference between the __sum of all sources__ and the __mixture__. The result of the compression is a bandwidth, limited to 16 kHz. This difference has _no impact_ on the bsseval evaluation performance.

## `MUSDB18-HQ` Uncompressed WAV

<img src="./assets/sd-hd.png" width="800px">

As an alternative, we also offer the uncompressed WAV files for models that aim to predict high bandwidth of up to 22 kHz. Other than that, `MUSDB18-HQ` is identical to `MUSDB18`.

::: warning Note
If you want to compare separation models to existing source separation literature or if want compare to SiSEC 2018 participants, you should use the standard `MUSDB18` dataset, instead.

## Errata

Throughout the years, we found a few errors in the dataset. At some point we are going to fix them and issue a new release:
